## Psychological_stress
- Stress is feeling a strain or pressure.
- Typically one perceives stress when you don't believe that you have the
  resources to deal with some kind of obstacle.
- What's so interesting about it though is that it's about your perception.
  Both conscious and subconscious.
- Stress is not necessarily a bad thing.
- Positive stress, called eustress, plays a factor in motivation.
    - Say you're visiting a friends house for a surprise birthday and become
      stressed out about being late, which motivates you to move faster or take
      a different route, or skip out visiting the shops on the way.
    - Or maybe you become stressed about a new project or an interview. That
      psychological stress can motivate you to research or prepare better.
- Negative stress, called distress, occurs when you perceive a demand to vastly
  exceed your capabilities.
    - Perhaps on the way to your friends house the traffic is so bad that you
      realise you're going to miss the surprise. On top of this the radio is
      stuck on a channel you don't like and your friends keep ringing you.
      That might cause your distress.
    - Or you get asked a critical question in an interview, which you don't know
      the answer to. If your perception is that you will lose the position if
      you don't answer correctly, then that might causes you a lot of distress
      as the obstacle appears insurmountable.

- These obsacles or demands are called stressors. Anything which might cause a
  person stress
    - Always neutral
    - four main types:
        - crises
          - natural disasters, floods, earthquakes, global pandemics
        - major life events
          - marriage, leaving home for the first time, death of a loved one,
            birth of a child, divorce
        - microstressors
            - daily annoyances, making decisions, conflict
        - ambient
            pollution, noise, crowding

Try to do it in a work-context:
- Other people's stressors might not necessarily be the same stressors as yours
- Especially now, another person's work environment might be less comfortable
  than yours.
- It's important to try and consider this when.
